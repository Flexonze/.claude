# Prime - Codebase Understanding

Get a comprehensive understanding of the codebase and optionally dive deep into a specific feature.

## Instructions

### 1. Explore the Codebase

Investigate and understand the codebase:

- Technology stack and architecture
- Project structure and key directories
- Important files and entry points
- Development workflow

### 2. Feature Analysis (Optional)

If `$1` is provided, also investigate that specific feature:

- Find where the feature is implemented
- Understand how it works
- Identify related files and dependencies
- Note any relevant tests or configuration

### 3. Share Your Findings

Present what you learned about the codebase and feature in a clear, helpful way.
