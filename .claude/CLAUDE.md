## Self-improving Claude setup

- When the user provides feedback or requests a change that represents a generic coding pattern, style preference, or best practice (not specific to the current task), add it as a new guideline in CLAUDE.md
- When the user performs a task that could be automated or reused, ask if they want to create a new skill (using `/create-skill`) for it
